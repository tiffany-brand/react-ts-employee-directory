## Description
This application allows a user to view a table of basic information about employees (employee data loaded from the Random User API). The user can sort the employees by first name, last name, gender, email address, phone number, city or state. Employees can also be filtered on those same fields by entering text into the search field.

### User Story

AS A user
I WANT to be able to view my entire employee directory at once 
SO THAT I have quick access to their information.


### Development Notes

I began creating this application using JavaScript in a different GitHub repository. You can view my commit history of building the JavaScript logic and styling here: 

[React Employee Directory - JavaScript](https://github.com/tiffany-brand/react-employee-directory)

Because I am learning TypeScript, I decided to convert my project to TypeScript. This repository contains my commit history for that conversion, as well as the final revisions I made. The deployed link below leads to the final TypeScript deployed application.
